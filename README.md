## Low-cost beam profiler (WIP)

Knowing the exact diameter and profile of a laser beam is highly beneficial for a wide range of (bio-)optical applications; e.g. determining the power distribution of your laser spot to avoid radiation damage on your sample or optical elements. Unluckily, commercial beam profilers (either camera based or scanning slit / knife-edge devices) usually cost several k EUR. Consequently, several research groups have created designs for low-cost beam profiler.

Here, we present our approach to a low-cost beam profiler, which utilizes a webcam for the profile recording and is designed for collimated laser beams with large diameters. The setup is built of three major components (Fig. 1):

(i) a neutral density filter (optical density typically between three and for) for the attenuation of the laser power to facilitate the measurement with a standard webcam;

(ii) a lens system for demagnification of the laser beam - with f2/f1 = M, the desired demagnification;

(iii) a cheap webcam with a sensor chip which is easily accessible by disassembly of the webcam and an elevated surface in the webcam housing for easy mounting.
