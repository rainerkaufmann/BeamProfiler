## Low-cost beam profiler (WIP)

Knowing the exact diameter and profile of a laser beam is highly beneficial for a wide range of (bio-)optical applications; e.g. determining the power distribution of your laser spot to avoid radiation damage on your sample or optical elements. Unluckily, commercial beam profilers (either camera based or scanning slit / knife-edge devices) usually cost several k EUR. Consequently, several research groups have created designs for low-cost beam profiler.

Here, we present our approach to a low-cost beam profiler, which utilizes a webcam for the profile recording and is desigend for collimated laser beams with large diameters. The setup is built of three major components (Fig. XXX):
